## Technical Background
My background in full-stack software development has been acquired through internships, study abroad experiences, and my academic degrees. Most recently, I completed an internship at Atomic Object as a Software Consultant & Developer. Within the summer, I developed API and Backend-for-Frontend endpoints, integrated them into a cross-platform mobile app, and wrote unit and end-to-end tests to deliver a minimum viable product. During the summer of 2023, I embarked on a transformative study abroad program to Switzerland focussing on cutting-edge areas such as deep learning, visualization, big data, and machine learning. Then the summer of 2022, I was a Software Developer Intern at Auto Owners Insurance Company and went through configuration training, acquired proficiency in a proprietary language, and continued the internship part-time during the school year. Because of these three experiences in addition to a multitude of others, my skillset spans across various programming languages, frameworks, and tools which are listed below.

**Programming Languages:** Python, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, Swift, SQL, C, Kotlin, and HTML

**Frameworks:** React Native, Detox, SwiftUI, Node.js, Jest, Cypress, and PyTorch

**Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Tableau, Miro, Figma, Xcode, Docker, GitHub, Git, and Trello
